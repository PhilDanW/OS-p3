implement a monitor using semaphores

This program implements the consumer and producer problem. It implements the concept of a monitor and uses it to solve the problem.

Problems:
In early testing of my program, everything was working fine and producer and consumers were working normally
Currently I am having trouble getting the semaphores to create as I keep getting an error from perror telling me that a file exists already.
I have been doing extensive research to find out how to fix this bug, but with the deadline passed, and me having to use a late submission, I must turn it in as is.

If there are any suggestions on how to fix this problem, please let me know upon grading!!
